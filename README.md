# MicroML
On the Interpretability and Overfitting of Machine Learning for Macroeconomic Predictions 


## Objectives 

In this project, we intend to study the following three aspects of the ML models for Macroeconomic Predictions:  

- Test robustness of robustness of ML prediction models using different datasets: US-MD, CAN-MD and UK-MD 

- Interpretability - test the robustness of Shapley value based SHAP (and potentially others)â€¯ approaches 

- Overfitting - test the robustness of existing and proposed (by Chapman & Desai) cross-valiation approaches 


## Plan 

- Stage 1: Exploratory Data Analysis 

- Stage 2: Model tuning and cross-validation 

- Stage 3: Model interpretation
